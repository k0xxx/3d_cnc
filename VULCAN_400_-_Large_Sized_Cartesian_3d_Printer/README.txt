# Summary

(WORK IN PROGRESS) 
The Vulcan 400, a modular 3D Printer designed for printing large objects. Objects as large as 400 x 400 x 210 approximately (Larger build size is possible). Z-axis assembly is modular allowing user to use a range of different build plate sizes. Any extruder system can be attached using a suitable mounting part which connects to the x-axis connector plate. This printer could be also used as a light duty cnc router. (More will be added also)

!! Actual Build Size: 430mm x 366mm x 210mm !!
!! Non Standard thin walled bearings used          !!
